## Abstract

The pervasive nature of hate speech on digital platforms has highlighted the need for more robust automated detection mechanisms. This project delves into the classification of hate speech in tweets, leveraging three distinct embedding techniques: BERT, GloVe, and word2vec. While one segment of our project will employ the DistilBERT model, capitalizing on its advanced transformer architecture, the others concurrently explore the potential of word2vec and GloVe embeddings. It also tries to address the unique challenge of multiple annotations per tweet using a majority voting approach. This threefold embedding exploration aims to offer a comparative analysis on the efficacy of each approach for hate speech detection. Future endeavors will harness cloud-based platforms to facilitate extensive model training and evaluation.
